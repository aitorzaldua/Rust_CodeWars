/* 
You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).
Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.

Examples
A size 3 diamond:

 *
***
 *
...which would appear as a string of " *\n***\n *\n"

A size 5 diamond:

  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
...that is:

"  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n" */




fn main() {
    let n = 5;
    let x = (1..=10)
        .collect::<Vec<i32>>();
    println!("{:?}", x);
}


fn print(n: i32) -> Option<String> {
    if n < 0 || n % 2 == 0 {
        return None;
    }

    let n = n as usize;
    let diamond = (1..=n)
        .chain((1..n).rev())
        .step_by(2)
        .map(|i| format!("{}{}\n", " ".repeat((n - i) / 2), "*".repeat(i)))
        .collect();

    Some(diamond)
}
